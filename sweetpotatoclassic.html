        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Once you taste this, you won't ever go back to the marshmallow-topped variety! I have peeled and cooked in the microwave, and also boiled the sweet potatoes. They taste the same no matter how you cook them. So, use the technique that works best for you!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>5 sweet potatoes</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ cup butter</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
                <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
